Map of airports in the United States

This is a cloropleth map that shows the density of airports in each state of the United States. 
Each airplane represents an airport, and will display the name of the airport upon clicking the marker.
My additional function adds 2 image overlays, an airplane and an air traffic control tower. 
Libraries include Leaflet, font-awesome, chroma and jquery.
